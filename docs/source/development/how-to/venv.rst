How To Set Up a Virtual Python Environment (Linux)
**************************************************

``virtualenv`` is a tool to create isolated Python environments.  You can read more about it in the
`Virtualenv documentation <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.  This article provides a quick summary to help
you set up and use a virtual environment.

A Note About Python 3.6 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
============================================

If you're running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (or and earlier version), Python 3.5 is likely installed by default. *Don't remove
it!*  To get Python 3.6, follow the instructions in this section.

Add the PPA
^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following command to add the Python 3.6 PPA.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6

Check for Updates and Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check for updates and install Python 3.6 via the following commands.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3.6

Now you have three Python version, use ``python`` to run version 2.7, ``python3`` for version 3.5, and ``python3.6``
for version 3.6.

For more information on this subject, check out Ji m's article
`How to Install Python 3.6.1 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS <http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/07/install-python-3-6-1-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/>`_.




Create a Virtual Python Environment
===================================

``cd`` to your project directory and run ``virtualenv`` to create the new virtual environment.

The following commands will create a new virtual environment under my-project/my-venv.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd my-project
    virtualenv --python python3.6 venv

Activate the Environment
========================

Now that we have a virtual environment, we need to activate it.

.. code-block:: bash

    source venv/bin/activate

After you activate the environment, your command prompt will be modified to reflect the change.

Add Libraries and Create a *requirements.txt* File
====================================================

After you activate the virtual environment, you can add packages to it using ``pip``. You can also create a description
of your dependencies using ``pip``.

The following command creates a file called ``requirements.txt`` that enumerates the installed packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

This file can then be used by collaborators to update virtual environments using the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Deactivate the Environment
==========================

To return to normal system settings, use the ``deactivate`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    deactivate

After you issue this command, you'll notice that the command prompt returns to normal.
